# Project Overview

<p>In this project a ready made web-based RSS feedreader was provided, with the intention of writing test suites to 
test the app. To run the app, open index.html in any web browser or visit  https://ovsundal.github.io/Feed-Reader-Testing/. All code i wrote for this project is in 
/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js - everything else was provided.</p>

<p>This project is part of Udacitys Front-End Web Developer nanodegree program 
(https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).</p>

## Learning outcomes

* Using Jasmine framework for JavaScript unit testing  
* Better understanding of how asynchronous requests work and how to simplify requests using callback functions
* A clever trick to test that an array only has unique entries; create a set from the array and compare lengths. If equal lengths it follows that the array has no duplicates as a set only has unique values
